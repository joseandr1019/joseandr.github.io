<p>I was the designer for designing the custom level area to teach the player the basics of what the new powerup can do.</p>
<p>I was also the programmer that handled coding all of the enemy logic and related logic such as basic damage dealing, knockback / hitstun, ans health / dying.</p>
<p>Finally, I was also responsible for giving Samus her animations across Brinstar.</p>
<p>This project was created in Unity with C#.</p>
