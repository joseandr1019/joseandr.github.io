10/8/23 Meeting

Met with design to discuss how new features such as player status effects, new special complete archetypes, and new enemy attacks will work.
Also helped discuss with programmer colleagues on shifting enemy attack focus to a scriptable object design, where we can create a template
that we create from Assets menu to fill in the attack data, which battle can call when attacking.

Meeting: 2 Hours
