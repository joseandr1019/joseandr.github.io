<p>This was a prototype project to see what we can do with a custom mechanic given a limited timeframe.</p>
<p>Within two weeks, I was responsible for creating the logic and binding everything together for this protoype on my own.</p>
<p>The main mechanic of focus for the game was the ability to Chromashift.</p>
<p>Chromashifting allows the player to change their color to one of the primary colors (in this case, Red & Blue) which allows the player to bypass obstacles of the same color<br>
while making the player immune to enemies of the same type. The enemy immunity works in reverse, forcing the player to think if they want to shift for protection, or shift out to attack.</p>
<p>Further expansion ideas would be navigation locked behind having certain colors or color mixes on hand, and having enemies with unavoidable attacks forcing the player to choose offense or defense for a few seconds.</p>
<p>This project was created in Unity with C#.</p>
