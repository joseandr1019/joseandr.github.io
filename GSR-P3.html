<p>GSR is a zero gravity combat racer, with a focus on the players fighting each other and the AI drones.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>I was the primary 3D modeler for this project. I created the two tracks with regards to our design philosphy of giving the players straights to shoot the other player.</p>

<p>I also worked on creating the logic for the UI to have some additional juice to them.
The juice includes button selection flashing and the track models moving and scaling on selection.</p>
