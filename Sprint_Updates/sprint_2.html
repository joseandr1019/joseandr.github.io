<h2>Sprint 2, Alpha, Feature Locking in Progress</h2>
<p>
    The second sprint had me working further on implementing status effects for use for the player, enemies,
    player attacks, and enemy attacks.
</p>

<h3>Sprint 2.1 Meeting</h3>
<p>
    Met with design to discuss this sprint's plans to include new status effects, special complete archetypes,
    and status handling for player and enemies. Also met with programming to discuss the division of labor between us.
    <br>
    [Meeting: 2 hours]
</p>

<h3>Initial Player Status Handler Implementation</h3>
<p>
    This week I started working on creating a player profile so that enemies can inflict status effects on the player. 
    This change also added to EnemyAttacks the ability to inflict status effects, status effects to be inflicted regardless of target,
    and a change in calm to affect attack power instead of attack chance.

    [Implementation: 2 hours]
</p>

<h3>Sprint 2.2 Meeting</h3>
<p>
    This meeting I met with encounter to discuss the beginning of feature locking.
    Programming assigned me to assist with the foundational code base for combat.
    <br>
    [Meeting: 2 hours]
</p>

<h3>Status Handler Meeting</h3>
<p>
    I had a sub meeting with my QA lead to discuss how status effects should work going forward to establish
    a base template for other programmers to work with.
    <br>
    [Sub-Meeting: 0.5 hours]
</p>

<h3>Partial Status Handler Implementation</h3>
<p>
    I worked on updating the status handlers to handle special Field Effects like Siphon Essence,
    as well as handling what happens when conflicting status effects like Calm and Riled occur.
    This also involved looking at the new, existing status handler and looking at the design pages
    of status effects to see what would need to be changed and added.
