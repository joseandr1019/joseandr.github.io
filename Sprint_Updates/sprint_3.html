<h2>Sprint 2.3</h2>
<p>
    The week of Sprint 2.3 (10/22 - 10/28), design sat us down and told us that we wanted a finished build that works for the designs
    presented up to now. This was to include the enemies presented, their attacks, the attacks’ status effects, their special complete
    objectives, and the player action minigames. My goal for the week was to have the status effects that the player and enemy attacks
    inflict fully working.
</p>

<h3>Status Effect 90% Implementation</h3>
<p>
    My list of status effects to implement were Calm (player & enemy), Rile Up (enemy), Dissuade (enemy), Poison (player), and the special
    effect Siphon Essence (player). Rile Up and Poison were already implemented by someone else working on enemy attacks, so I tackled the
    other three. Calm & Rile Up didn’t need changing but a conditional was needed when applying so that the two effects cancel each other
    rather than creating a new unadjusted value. Dissuade was a trickier one (how do I track the recent action and sealed action?), but I
    decided to have the status handlers do some of the work. When an enemy uses an attack, the player status handler will save it. When the
    player uses the action ‘Convince’, when inflicting Dissuade, it will call upon Dissuade’s constructor* which will take the save the
    recent action saved by the player and seal it in the enemy’s status handler. Siphon Essence was another trickier one (how do I keep track
    of the victim and siphoner to deal damage and heal?), and I decided to use another constructor*. When the enemy inflicts Siphon Essence,
    the effect will track the inflicter’s HealthSystem and the victim’s HealthSystem and handle the effect when the EndOfRound event is
    published. This took me about 3½ hours over a Sunday evening (10/22) and a Monday Night (10/23)
    <br><br>
    * - Hindsight’s a prick and it was a flawed and more complicated solution to use a constructor for these effects, as I would find out
    the next day.
    <br>
    [Implementation: 3.5 hours]
</p>

<h3>Status Effect Simplicity Change</h3>
<p>
    Constructors were a bad idea, and there’s a simpler solution for both Dissuade and Siphon Essence. I had a suspicion that constructors
    were improper but couldn’t think of why at the moment, so I asked a couple other programmers to look at it and help rubber duck debug.
    Dissuade can be much simpler by having the enemy status handler track the recent action used, then when Dissuade is inflicted, seal the
    currently saved recent attack. With Siphon Essence, I relied on the fact that the project has certain restrictions to make this simpler.
    There is only ever one enemy in battle, and the lone player. If Siphon Essence is active on the player, I can handle Siphon Essence
    directly in the battle controller at the end of round. I recognize that this won’t work on bigger scale project, but for now this
    solution works for the project limitations without creating something even more needlessly complicated. This took me about an hour
    Tuesday evening during a meeting with other Quest programmers.
    <br><br>
    I also discovered two new bugs, one from my forgetting to do null checking (I also learned the null conditional operator is a thing), and
    a really bad bug that the player is not the player.
    <br>
    [Implementation Fix: 1 hour]
</p>

<h3>The Player Icon bug</h3>
<p>
    The player in the battle controller is supposed to be the player object which contains the player’s Health System and Status Handler.
    However, while debugging the null condition issue above, I found that the player in the Battle Controller has neither, as it’s the
    player’s Battle Icon.
    <br><br>

    it’s the ‘Player Battle Icon’ object instead of the player proper." witdh="600" height="600">
    <br><br>
    I did not have the proper knowledge of Battle Controller to fix this, so I decided to make it known to those who did so they can fix
    this as I believe my trying to fix it would only lead to more damage.
    <br><br>
    However, considering the time constraint, I decided to take a crack at it first, and all it needed was adding a couple components to
    the player icon to work. This took about an hour and a half Friday evening to implement and test.
    <br>
    [Icon Fix: 1.5 hours]
</p>

<h2>Sprint 3.1</h2>

<h3>Work Session</h3>
<p>
    During the work session Friday evening I added in the remaining status effects and added in a couple special complete objectives.
    Not much was needed to be added on my end initially. A few more events and that was part of my session. I did learn however that I’m
    the creator of bugs as Unity Objects do not support a null conditional operator. At least I learned that Unity Objects don’t have one
    but it exists in other languages. Worked for about 3 hours.

    [Implementation: 3 hours]
</p>

<h3>End of Week Wrap Up</h3>
<p>
    I wanted to see where minigames were dealing damage and found that they don’t. So I worked on creating my own function for dealing damage.
    Added a new field for minigames for how much damage they deal, adjusted the player status handler to have a multiplier for damage which is
    adjusted by Calm. Took about four hours searching for an existing function, creating the function, and resolving merge conflicts.

    [Fixing: 4 hours]
    <br>
    [Total: 13 hours]
