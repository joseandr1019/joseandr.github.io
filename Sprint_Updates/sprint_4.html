</h2>
<p>
    During the meeting we decided to do a playtest to figure out what bugs exist and what fixes need to happen. I was assigned to deal with a
    couple of the bugs that were found during the playtest.

    The project leads decided to extend the project to be a two-cycle project. During the meeting we decided to have a sanity check playtest

<h2>
    11/17/23 Worksession + Playtest
</h2>
<p>
    Assisted with taking notes for the playtest w/ Cameron Brown. After the playtest is over, I also fixed a couple bugs relating to the Hidden
    Field Effect object (If the filename and class name conflict, not fun stuff occurs). Added a placeholder delay between player actions and
    enemy actions using Invoke while art implementation is still underway.
