    Worksession 12/1/23
</h2>

<p>
    I decided to tackle some remaining of the remaining features in the backlog such as a Jester mechanic and adding descriptions to active
    battle cards. There were also a few bugs I noticed that I would have to debug later that I thought were already dealt with, such as Siphon
    not actually damaging/healing when applied. Overall, found that there were still a few kinks that I would need to hard test to make sure work
    before I start creating proper documentation for the end of this cycle and the beginning of next cycle.

<h2>
    Self Work Day 12/3/23
</h2>
<p>
    Had a partial meeting today where I discussed some present bugs and where we were at in terms code for the project. Some bugs still exist
    but the systems for combat are all in. I finally took care of a bug plaguing an attack option and fixed another bug caused by a slight 
    misunderstanding. I also noted from design that I need to go through and mark down what I did work on, as well as create a set of documentation
    so that new devs, or retasked devs know what they're looking at. And considering that this project is as systems heavy as it is, that write up will
    need to be done before the next cycle.

    [Studio Meeting: 1 hour]
    [Self Work: 2 Hours]
    [Total: 7 Hours]
